## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Gamirare is on the long way to creating the Miramixi Storyteller and some side projects. Look our progress on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/olfamelles)!

## Miramixi Storyteller

Miramixi Storyteller is designed to provide a new gaming experience and convenient functionality for organizing the gameplay. This is a single-user / cooperative 3d RPG with freedom of action, similar to the world-famous system of Dungeons and Dragons. The platform offers many tools for configuration:

 - game locations with a handy editor
 - interactivity of game objects
 - non-game characters, primitive dialogues
 - a simple and intuitive interface for the player and the game master

The player can customize game locations and objects with a convenient editor, determine the behavior and dialogues of non-game characters. During the game, the wizard can control the world through a user-friendly interface. We hope this will help players better immerse themselves in the world of adventure. Pleasant, detailed, but at the same time clear combat system, will fully enjoy all the benefits of combat that exist in board role-playing games.

Create your character, the character story and immerse yourself in the world of Adrios. Share your own worlds where other players can immerse themselves in exciting adventures with a great story.

The main platform for the game is the PC. We use the Unity game engine to implement our ideas. In the mobile application and on web pages, users will continue to enjoy game mechanics, developing their characters.

Community is very important in this kind of project. Users will be able to find company for games, new acquaintances and friends. Just communicate and share ideas and achievements.

Marketplace is a place where users can find a variety of supporting materials for their adventures: 3D models, textures, sounds, and more that players may need to create their own settings and stories.
